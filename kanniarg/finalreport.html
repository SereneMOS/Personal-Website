        I didn't think we'd really find the bodies. After looking at them,
        I almost wish we didn't-- but I'm calling it here.
        If we try chasing this thing any further, it'll kill us.
        I don't know what to do. I'm pretty sure we've been compromised
        but I don't know how. I tried stashing the records of
        everything somewhere but its a rushjob so I'm hoping there's
        no spill out into an accessible forum. Either way, I'm
        axing myself from this mess. I don't care to keep the
        charade up, so once you get this, everything's yours to
        do with as you please. Scrub me from the records and take it
        to the authorities or something, I don't know. <br><br>

        As I'm writing this, though, I do recall that I have a
        stash of the final "memorabilia" I want to get rid of, which,
        if you're really intent on putting together a complete case then...<br><br>

        Something's not right. Someone is reading this that isn't
        supposed to be able to. I knew it; we're compromised. I'm
        logging off and burning my trail. If you want the cache, then my
        last instruction is clear:<br><br>

        <h1>Find me before whoever is watching does, and soon.</h1>
