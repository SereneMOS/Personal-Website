    I didn't think we'd really find the bodies. After looking at them,
    I almost wish we didn't. But I'm calling it here.
    If we try chasing this thing any further, it'll kill us.
    I don't know what to do. I'm pretty sure we've been compromised,
    not sure how. I get that you're insistent on rectifying things
    in your own way, but I want you to know I don't want any part
    in it. I've scrubbed myself from everything on the hard drive, and
    handed it off to ____. Get it from ____, and you can pass
    it over to whoever you want.
