            Congrats on following the clue I left, and welcome to your anniversary
            gift! This page is the first part of the ARG I've been chipping away
            at for a good while now, so let me break things down for you.<br>
            Each puzzle is themed around our relationship and history, so
            it'll serve you well to remember such things. The first gate
            is before you and its a pretty easy start. I've only got a few
            "rules" I want to clarify up front though.<br>
            <li>
                You get three hints from me across the entire game.
            </li>
            <li>
                You can ask other people besides me for help solving puzzles.
            </li>
            <li>
                Play fair! No stooping in places you shouldn't be to cheat.
            </li>
            In order to progress, you must find the four-letter key. <br>
