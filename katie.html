    <h1>Hello My Love!</h1>
    <body>
        Congrats on following the clue I left, and welcome to your anniversary
        gift! This page is the first part of the ARG I've been chipping away
        at for a good while now, so let me break things down for you.<br>
        Each puzzle is themed around our relationship and history, so
        it'll serve you well to remember such things. The first gate
        is before you and its a pretty easy start. I've only got a few
        "rules" I want to clarify up front though.<br>
        <li>
            You get three hints from me across the entire game.
        </li>
        <li>
            You can ask other people besides me for help solving puzzles.
        </li>
        <li>
            Play fair! No stooping in places you shouldn't be to cheat.
        </li>
        In order to progress, you must find the four-letter key. <br>
