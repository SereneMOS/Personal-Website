                    <div>
                        Hi! I'm so glad you're here on my website, reading
                        my blog posts. There are four types of posts I plan on having here,
                        for now, anyway, as I could add more types as per my own discretion.
                        The four types of posts are Blogs (this post's type), Poems, Short Stories,
                        and Word of the Whatever. The first three seem self explanatory enough,
                        but that last one may merit some explanation; I really enjoy words, a lot!
                        At the time of writing, I am the President of RIT Wordsmiths, and I even
                        made my own langauge (lessons on it hopefully coming soon). I decided
                        that I wanted to have a type of post showcasing a word that I'd 
                        become enamored with, so that's what Word of the Whatever is.
                        Anyway, have fun poking around and reading. I worked very hard on this
                        website and this page especially, so please indulge me.

                    <div>
                        One day, you’re going to see her again,</br>
                        Maybe at the movies, maybe at the park-</br>
                        Maybe when you’re long dead and rotting</br>
                        But on that day, she will be as wide-eyed as ever</br>
                        And I don’t think she’ll recognize you</br>
                        But you’ll both know its each other</br>
                        I wonder what you’ll say to her</br>
                        I wouldn’t be too nervous</br>
                        Because she’s going to adore you</br>
                        But despite her admiration</br>
                        You’ll be besieged with nothing but grief,</br>
                        Because all you’ll be able to see</br>
                        Is all of her defilement</br>
                        And you’ll want to say sorry</br>
                        For everything that happened,</br>
                        Even though it wasn’t your fault</br>
                        And you’ll want to say sorry</br>
                        For trying so hard to bury her- for calling her naive,</br>
                        When you didn’t know who to blame</br>
                        And you’ll want to say sorry</br>
                        That it wasn’t you who looked after her,</br>
                        Or that you couldn’t live out her dreams</br>
                        I wonder how she’ll react</br>
                        So on that day, when you see her</br>
                        Give her a hug for me, please?

                    <div>
                        &emsp; It’s not the kind of thing anyone would have noticed right away. I mean, how could it have been? 
                        Slowly but surely, however, people took notice. Maybe it was a lucky guess, an interruption in a 
                        pattern too rigid to go unnoticed when disturbed, or, given the circumstances, likely divine 
                        prognostication. Those first few to say something were passed off as all sorts of things-–
                        ”up the pole”, mistaken, or, in the best of cases, assumed to be joking–-but their words 
                        planted a seed, a viral notion that would inevitably take hold. In a few days time, after mocking 
                        the inane rumor over lunch with coworkers or on the bus with friends, something wouldn’t sit right. 
                        Next time, you’d be sure to remember if it happened, and dread would start to set in when you woke. 
                        Everyone you met would start parroting the same thing, the same troubling idea.</br>
	                    &emsp; As the world at large came to see these ramblings as truth, there was panic. For some, 
                        the change didn’t affect them at all, but obviously, the thought was spine chilling nonetheless. 
                        Religious figures, scientists, politicians, philosophers, and other swaths of humanity drew their 
                        own conclusions, and tried to settle the nerves.</br>
	                    &emsp; “‘Tis the judgment of God upon the wicked,” claimed one pastor.</br>
	                    &emsp; “A new virus, perhaps?” postulated a scientist.</br>
	                    &emsp; “Must be a weapon from the Chinese,” asserted military leadership.</br>
                        &emsp; Try as they might, and for as confident as they all sounded, none knew the truth. However, the 
                        seasons changed, as did the interest of most people. Since nothing bad had come from it, it 
                        must be fine, right?</br>
	                    &emsp; And so, years passed, then decades, and all of the world started to forget what had even happened. 
                        It would be of great intrigue to the historians of the day to piece together such a significant event. 
                        How could humankind have been so foolish as to not understand the gravity of the situation? 
                        I suppose hindsight is 20/20. And so, through vigorous work, the appraisal of the remnants of their 
                        predecessors, and a little bit of educated guessing, these antiquarians pinpointed it: the day humanity 
                        lost something it would never again recover. The day that slumber would then and forever be met by a void.</br>
	                    &emsp; The day humanity stopped dreaming.

                        can. "I appraise the situation as dangerous", "To my

                        This has been a big favorite word of mine as of late. I like
                        to think of myself as goth-aligned, especially when it comes to
                        classical goth iconography, like, gasp, blood! I'm a very
                        big fan of Bloodborne, which is more Victorian than goth, but
                        I digress, and the signs of viscera cover the game head to toe.
                        Viscera is a fun word though, and cuts a lot deeper than just 
                        saying "blood" or "guts" in my opinion. As I look for a name
                        for my newly acquired naginata, I circle back around to 
                        viscera, if not for the whole name, then at least part of it.

                        the affront to one's superiority that is involved.</br>
                        Fun fact, I have been using this word wrong! Not sure
                        where I got the idea from, but I thought it meant
                        'to judge' or 'to determine', which I suppose isn't too
                        far off from the actual definition. I'm glad no one
                        caught me on it before I looked it up, though, or else
                        I'd have looked like a fool. You know what they say about
                        assuming, after all.

                    <div>
                        There have been a swirl of changes in my life as of late,
                        and the two I want to spotlight today are the game I've been working
                        on, and my weight gain progress.</br>
                        About a month before writing this, my girlfriend approached me with
                        the idea to make a video game together, and though I was busy,
                        I agreed to help. The idea we came up with was a 3D platformer
                        game using retro graphics akin to N64 or PS1 games, and is about
                        a little fellow exploring a universe filled with cosmic
                        horror entities. I've been very busy with this website, so my
                        girlfriend has been doing the bulk of the development
                        so far (with a bit of help from some others), but I'll be
                        doing some level design and lore writing once I'm more free.</br>
                        Around the same time, I started changing strategy in gaining
                        some weight. I've always been a little thinner than average
                        for my height, and I've been trying to gain weight so I meet 
                        a figure I'm more proud of. My dietician suggested to eat more
                        snacks, but that didn't help too much. It was a friend of mine
                        who body builds that suggested I bulk by going on a calorie
                        surplus, and that has helped a lot! I've been seeing a 1 pound
                        increase a week so far, but, as expected, that weight does
                        fluctuate up and down.

                    <div>
                        Wow, it has been a hot minute, hasn't it? The past few months
                        have been keeping me busy, what with the fall semester in full swing
                        and whatnot, but with a whirlwind of things going on that means there's
                        no shortage of things to blog about! <br>
                        Two things have been getting me through the thick of it have been
                        my burgeoning practice of Witchcraft and Naginatajutsu. The latter
                        has been of interest to me for a long time, but buying even
                        a simple practice spear was gonna run me a couple hundred bucks
                        (yikes!) One day, however, I was at a Renn Faire over the summer,
                        and I saw her, resting gentle and fair in the corner of a smithy.
                        I was smitten in a flash, and for the low, low price of 500 bucks,
                        she was mine! Definitely a little bit of an impulse purchase,
                        but I've been putting it to good use so no worries. <br>
                        Resources online are hard to find, since naginatajutsu is a bit
                        obscure here in the states as a hobby or sport-- especially
                        in comparison to something like kendo-- but I've managed
                        to find a few tutorials and handbooks to help practice.
                        I don't see myself performing or competing or anything, but
                        its a fun skill to learn, and a good way to get some needed
                        exercise in. <br>
                        The next big shift has come from my newfound practice of
                        witchcraft! Don't fret-- I won't be sacrificing infants or
                        flying around on brooms (probably), but rather exploring esoterica
                        and the lingering power of the subconscious. There's no need to
                        go into everything about the practice or history, especially since
                        practice is so individualized, but just know that the change in
                        my perspective has helped me recitfy a lot of the stray thoughts
                        or conundrums that have been bouncing around my head for a long time
                        now.

                        I'm only including this one because my girlfriend
                        kept pointing out that I say it. It's one of those things
                        I just sort of say by default when someone else
                        makes an interesting point and I don't have anything
                        direct to say after that. I wouldn't have even
                        noticed I say it so much if it wasn't pointed out, but
                        I suppose thats one of the sweet things about loved ones.

                        2025 is upon us, and, for me at least, its already
                        bringing some... interesting challenges my <span>W</span>ay. That said,
                        I'm happy to bring some new changes to the website, even <span>i</span>f they
                        aren't anything crazy. I've been cooking up the chess game
                        for some time now, but its been giving me a lot more problems
                        than I was initially expecting, so it'll be a bit longer before
                        thats ready. However, I am going ahead and adding a new type of
                        post: Reviews! I tend to have a lot of thoughts on a lot of media
                        and art that I <span>c</span>onsume-- which also happens to be a lot-- and
                        I think it'd be just swell to have a place to put all of it.
                        I expect it to be something of an or<span>d</span>eal to get down but I
                        think the key, ultimately, is persistence.
                        I'll post my first couple of reviews soon, and probably a few
                        other writings as <span>w</span>ell. See you then!

                    <div class="name">Homestuck: The First Half</div>
                    <div>
                        It's hard to really know what to say about Homestuck when introudcing it.
                        By this point in internet history you've really either heard about it and
                        know the strange baggage the series has, or you've never heard of it at all--
                        at least for those of us born around the turn of the century, I'd argue.
                        Even then, most people haven't done the legwork of sitting down and reading
                        all 8000+ pages of the webcoming, and fewer still have done so twice as I have.
                        I should also clear the air and let it be known that these readings were both done
                        within the past couple of years, and prior I had known only the things picked
                        up through cultural osmosis like everyone else.<br>
                        That said, a lot of what I read stuck with me in a very profound way, to the point
                        where I may have to confess that I actually like Homestuck? It's hard to say.
                        I decided to break this review into two parts, covering everything up to EOA4 here,
                        since there's just an insane amount of material to cover and the second half
                        of HS is pretty different from the first. <br>
                        Homestuck starts slow. It's clear the author, Andrew Hussie, wasn't sure what to
                        do at first,  so the story meanders a little bit in the first few moves,
                        and it does seem like this is where most people fall off during their read.
                        That said, a lot of good characterization happens here, with introductions to
                        our four main characters: John, Rose, Dave, and Jade, it's just that more of this
                        characterization is actually retroactive than you'd probably expect. It's not
                        that nothing is happening- I mean, the whole first part of the story is about 
                        Earth being destroyed by meteors and the protagonists have to use a video
                        game to escape the same fate- it's just that there's a lot of jumping around
                        diversions that slow things down. This is what Homestuck is, and its entirely
                        understandable why that wouldn't be a lot of people's thing; everything I
                        am about to discuss in this post happens in one day, canonically.
